		1		00:00:31		198		-->		00:00:33		872		Someone sure stripped this place. 
		2		00:00:44		503		-->		00:00:46		631		The reactor is gone. 
		3		00:00:48		465		-->		00:00:51		469		No wonder they didn't answer our hail for two days. 
		4		00:00:51		677		-->		00:00:53		304		Nothing here to answer with. 
		5		00:00:53		512		-->		00:00:56		732		Commander, I'm detecting life signs from behind that door. 
		6		00:01:00		686		-->		00:01:04		486		Commander, take a look at this. 
		7		00:01:07		985		-->		00:01:09		578		Blood. 
		8		00:01:10		404		-->		00:01:12		577		Yes, but not human. 
		9		00:01:12		781		-->		00:01:14		954		I'm gonna have to do some analysis on it. 
		10		00:01:20		330		-->		00:01:22		298		It's jammed. 
		11		00:02:05		584		-->		00:02:09		805		<i>Space, the final frontier.</i> 
		12		00:02:10		464		-->		00:02:14		389		<i>These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.</i> 
		13		00:02:14		593		-->		00:02:19		895		<i>To explore strange new worlds,</i> 
		14		00:02:20		098		-->		00:02:24		103		<i>to seek out new life and new civilizations,</i> 
		15		00:02:24		645		-->		00:02:28		821		<i>to boldly go where no one has gone before.</i> 
		16		00:03:40		595		-->		00:03:43		724		The two scientists are suffering from phaser stuns. 
		17		00:03:43		932		-->		00:03:46		230		I'd guess several hits each. 
		18		00:03:46		435		-->		00:03:47		561		Several? 
		19		00:03:47		769		-->		00:03:51		114		It'll take us a while to bring them around, but they will recover. 
		20		00:03:51		314		-->		00:03:54		033		We found a sample of blood. 
		21		00:03:54		776		-->		00:03:57		780		It's a rare iron-copper composite. 
		22		00:03:57		988		-->		00:04:02		539		Unique to one humanoid species, the Acamarians. 
		23		00:04:04		411		-->		00:04:06		709		Acamarians? 
		24		00:04:07		456		-->		00:04:10		926		Then that would suggest the Gatherers. 
		25		00:04:11		126		-->		00:04:13		049		It is a likely hypothesis. 
		26		00:04:13		253		-->		00:04:16		348		The nomadic marauders who refer to themselves as Gatherers have raided other outposts in neighboring sectors. 
		28		00:04:19		426		-->		00:04:21		144		They've never come out this far before. 
		29		00:04:22		763		-->		00:04:25		812		Mr. Crusher, set course for the Acamar System. 
		30		00:04:26		016		-->		00:04:27		643		Aye, sir. 
		31		00:04:30		854		-->		00:04:34		575		<i>Captain's log, stardate <stardate>43421</stardate>.9.</i> 
		32		00:04:34		775		-->		00:04:37		574		<i>In an effort to put an end to the Gatherer raids,</i> 
		33		00:04:37		778		-->		00:04:39		451		<i>we have come to the Acamar System</i> 
		34		00:04:39		654		-->		00:04:43		955		<i>to enlist the aid of Marouk, the Sovereign of Acamar III.</i> 
		35		00:04:44		159		-->		00:04:46		287		Their raids have made this sector unsafe. 
		36		00:04:46		495		-->		00:04:48		135		They've ransacked our research facilities, our trade routes have been disrupted. 
		38		00:04:49		956		-->		00:04:51		924		The Gatherers are elusive. 
		39		00:04:52		125		-->		00:04:56		175		We've only managed to capture a handful of them. 
		40		00:04:56		379		-->		00:04:58		302		But with the Starfleet's help... 
		41		00:04:58		507		-->		00:05:02		353		Hunting them down is not what I am proposing. 
		42		00:05:02		552		-->		00:05:05		852		Reconciliation with the Gatherers is impossible. 
		43		00:05:06		056		-->		00:05:08		104		It's been tried. 
		44		00:05:08		558		-->		00:05:11		732		Every time we've offered amnesty, they've rejected it. 
		45		00:05:11		937		-->		00:05:15		282		- When was the last attempt made? - Eighteen years ago. 
		46		00:05:15		982		-->		00:05:17		154		Eighteen years? 
		47		00:05:17		359		-->		00:05:20		488		For almost a century now, they've been parasites, 
		48		00:05:20		695		-->		00:05:23		198		<i>moving from star system to star system,</i> living on what they could find or steal. 
		50		00:05:26		076		-->		00:05:28		295		- They're still your people. - No. 
		51		00:05:28		495		-->		00:05:33		592		Captain, you have to understand our history. 
		52		00:05:33		792		-->		00:05:35		920		A hundred years ago, before the Gatherers split off from our culture,  we were a savage, violent race. 
		55		00:05:42		175		-->		00:05:47		898		Clans battled clans, bloody, vengeful feuds that lasted for generations. 
		56		00:05:48		098		-->		00:05:53		446		But we overcame those ways, all except for the Gatherers. 
		57		00:05:53		645		-->		00:05:57		400		After a century of wandering, they may be ready to come home. 
		58		00:05:57		607		-->		00:06:00		486		Despite your progress, you are a divided society, and so it will remain until the Gatherers return to Acamar. 
		60		00:06:06		908		-->		00:06:08		751		The attempt may be futile. 
		61		00:06:08		952		-->		00:06:14		550		But there is so much to gain, and there is so little to lose by the effort. 
		62		00:06:14		749		-->		00:06:18		879		This problem affects us all. It cannot be ignored. 
		63		00:06:25		010		-->		00:06:26		762		Sovereign Marouk, welcome to the Bridge. 
		64		00:06:26		970		-->		00:06:29		223		Thank you, captain. 
		65		00:06:29		598		-->		00:06:31		646		How soon will you be ready to leave Acamar? 
		66		00:06:31		850		-->		00:06:33		022		I'm ready now, captain. 
		67		00:06:33		226		-->		00:06:35		228		I need only bring aboard two more servants. 
		68		00:06:35		437		-->		00:06:37		940		I'll see to that, and to your accommodations. 
		69		00:06:38		148		-->		00:06:42		449		I have reason to believe there is a Gatherer encampment somewhere in the Hromi Cluster. 
		71		00:06:49		075		-->		00:06:50		247		Mr. Data? 
		72		00:06:50		452		-->		00:06:52		500		The Federation has charted but not explored several Class-M planets in that area. 
		74		00:06:55		040		-->		00:06:58		294		Any one of these planets might serve well as a base. 
		75		00:06:59		294		-->		00:07:02		594		Mr. Crusher, set course for the Hromi Cluster. 
		76		00:07:02		797		-->		00:07:04		515		Aye, sir. 
		77		00:07:21		107		-->		00:07:25		362		- A fine ship, commander. - We're all very proud of her. 
		78		00:07:26		321		-->		00:07:30		622		Yuta, a light meal in 2O minutes. 
		79		00:07:31		242		-->		00:07:33		995		May I be shown the kitchen, commander? 
		80		00:07:34		204		-->		00:07:35		751		- You're the chef? - Yes. 
		81		00:07:35		956		-->		00:07:38		254		I'll prepare all meals for the sovereign and her servants. 
		82		00:07:38		458		-->		00:07:42		213		We can provide you with a kitchen, but it won't really be necessary. 
		83		00:07:42		420		-->		00:07:47		142		These food dispensers can synthesize anything that you may need. 
		84		00:07:47		342		-->		00:07:49		970		I'll show you. Sovereign, may I offer you a drink? 
		85		00:07:50		178		-->		00:07:52		727		Yes, thank you. Cold water. 
		86		00:07:52		931		-->		00:07:57		152		Computer, a glass of water, five degrees. 
		87		00:08:04		109		-->		00:08:05		281		Please. 
		88		00:08:10		448		-->		00:08:14		954		- You're also the food taster? - That's part of the cook's duties. 
		89		00:08:24		879		-->		00:08:26		597		I'm sure the sovereign will wish to sample many of the cuisines your ship has to offer,  but there are some Acamarian dishes that she will insist upon. 
		92		00:08:32		971		-->		00:08:34		143		I'll arrange for a technician to help program your recipes into the computer. 
		94		00:08:36		391		-->		00:08:38		439		Of course, I'll have to try some of them. 
		95		00:08:38		643		-->		00:08:41		442		- What's your specialty? - I have none. 
		96		00:08:41		646		-->		00:08:43		364		Don't be modest. 
		97		00:08:43		565		-->		00:08:47		786		You can't tell me that you haven't come up with a few culinary delights. 
		98		00:08:49		612		-->		00:08:53		913		- There is a spiced parthus dish. - Parthus? 
		99		00:08:54		117		-->		00:08:56		540		A green vegetable with fleshy roots. 
		100		00:08:57		037		-->		00:08:59		131		Parthus Ã© la Yuta. 
		101		00:08:59		330		-->		00:09:01		958		I look forward to tasting it. Sovereign. 
		102		00:09:03		376		-->		00:09:05		049		Chef. 
		103		00:09:18		099		-->		00:09:20		727		Now entering standard orbit of Gamma Hromi ll, sir. 
		104		00:09:20		935		-->		00:09:24		860		Captain, I am detecting life readings from the planet's surface as well as several small areas of thermal radiation  and carbon dioxide emissions indicative of combustion. 
		107		00:09:32		197		-->		00:09:33		494		Campfires, Data. 
		108		00:09:35		200		-->		00:09:36		702		Is that not what I said? 
		109		00:09:37		827		-->		00:09:40		046		- It's worth a look. - Make it so. 
		110		00:09:40		246		-->		00:09:43		170		Data. Worf. 
		111		00:10:36		594		-->		00:10:39		143		Artonian lasers. 
		112		00:10:44		519		-->		00:10:48		899		Tonkian homing beacons. Quite a collection. 
		113		00:11:03		454		-->		00:11:07		254		Noranium alloys, sir. Its salvage value is quite low. 
		114		00:11:07		458		-->		00:11:10		553		Looks like these Gatherers weren't too discriminating about what they steal. 
		115		00:11:10		753		-->		00:11:12		221		Commander. 
		116		00:11:20		305		-->		00:11:21		727		Ambush! 
		117		00:11:31		524		-->		00:11:34		573		Rigellian phaser rifles, sir. Not particularly powerful. 
		118		00:11:37		989		-->		00:11:39		912		Powerful enough. 
		119		00:11:44		996		-->		00:11:47		090		We came to talk. 
		120		00:11:54		380		-->		00:11:58		556		Your words are wasted, commander. They understand only this. 
		121		00:11:58		760		-->		00:12:00		762		We're here to establish a dialogue, Worf. 
		122		00:12:04		307		-->		00:12:05		729		Data, tell me about Noranium. 
		123		00:12:05		934		-->		00:12:09		234		- It vaporizes at...? - 2314 degrees, sir. 
		124		00:12:09		437		-->		00:12:11		735		- Of course, Noranium carbide... - Thank you, Data. 
		125		00:12:11		940		-->		00:12:13		283		Setting seven ought to do it. 
		126		00:12:16		778		-->		00:12:20		408		Three, two, one, now! 
		127		00:12:26		537		-->		00:12:29		757		Enterprise, four to beam up. 
		128		00:12:37		757		-->		00:12:39		600		Cowards! 
		129		00:12:52		689		-->		00:12:56		068		Your ambushes would be more successful if you bathed more often. 
		130		00:12:59		862		-->		00:13:02		035		We've brought the Sovereign of Acamar. 
		131		00:13:02		240		-->		00:13:06		120		- Marouk? Here? - With an offer of amnesty. 
		132		00:13:11		708		-->		00:13:14		461		Full dispensation will be extended to all Gatherers who are willing to return to Acamar Ill. 
		134		00:13:17		338		-->		00:13:19		761		You don't trust me, Marouk. 
		135		00:13:20		591		-->		00:13:23		595		- Should I? - But you expect me to trust you. 
		136		00:13:23		803		-->		00:13:26		477		Maybe you just poisoned it yourself. 
		137		00:13:28		725		-->		00:13:30		819		Taste this, Temarek. 
		138		00:13:46		242		-->		00:13:50		338		- Barbarians. This is futile. - Sovereign. 
		139		00:13:51		622		-->		00:13:53		420		Brull. 
		140		00:13:53		624		-->		00:13:55		251		Go home, old woman. 
		141		00:13:55		460		-->		00:13:58		964		You people haven't changed in a hundred years. 
		142		00:13:59		172		-->		00:14:02		142		You should know. You were there. 
		143		00:14:02		508		-->		00:14:03		555		Sit down! 
		144		00:14:04		594		-->		00:14:06		141		Please. 
		145		00:14:07		764		-->		00:14:08		856		Please. 
		146		00:14:17		648		-->		00:14:18		865		Now, we're here to talk. 
		147		00:14:19		067		-->		00:14:21		115		It's a waste of time, captain. 
		148		00:14:21		319		-->		00:14:23		822		They don't care about how they live. 
		149		00:14:24		030		-->		00:14:26		658		Am I supposed to believe that you care how we live? 
		150		00:14:26		866		-->		00:14:28		413		Yes. 
		151		00:14:29		077		-->		00:14:31		000		Brull, she's here, isn't she? 
		152		00:14:31		496		-->		00:14:33		624		Maybe you forced her to come, Picard. 
		153		00:14:35		875		-->		00:14:39		379		Nobody forces me anywhere, Brull. 
		154		00:14:39		837		-->		00:14:42		681		What is there for us on Acamar Ill? 
		155		00:14:43		800		-->		00:14:46		553		A life. A home. 
		156		00:14:46		761		-->		00:14:50		732		You can end your wanderings, your miserable existence. 
		157		00:14:52		225		-->		00:14:54		273		Do I look miserable to you? 
		158		00:14:58		606		-->		00:15:01		906		The clan wars are over, Brull. 
		159		00:15:02		110		-->		00:15:04		454		It is a past we're ashamed of. 
		160		00:15:04		654		-->		00:15:07		533		It is why you had to leave. 
		161		00:15:08		032		-->		00:15:12		708		Now it is time to come home. 
		162		00:15:17		875		-->		00:15:22		130		I want to speak privately with Sovereign Marouk and Picard. 
		163		00:15:22		338		-->		00:15:24		306		Everyone else, get out. 
		164		00:15:37		812		-->		00:15:39		109		Any insights? 
		165		00:15:39		313		-->		00:15:40		906		Brull's ready to negotiate. 
		166		00:15:41		065		-->		00:15:43		409		He just wants privacy so that he won't appear weak in front of the other Gatherers. 
		168		00:16:19		687		-->		00:16:22		907		You are the clan Lornack. 
		169		00:16:23		357		-->		00:16:25		030		What of it? 
		170		00:16:29		280		-->		00:16:32		454		- I've seen you before. - Yes. 
		171		00:16:33		159		-->		00:16:37		084		But it's impossible. 
		172		00:16:37		997		-->		00:16:40		466		No. Look closer. 
		173		00:16:41		959		-->		00:16:45		179		I am Yuta of the clan Tralesta. 
		174		00:16:57		600		-->		00:16:59		853		I am the last of my line. 
		175		00:17:00		061		-->		00:17:03		691		But my clan will outlive yours. 
		176		00:17:16		244		-->		00:17:18		042		Marouk's offer has value. 
		177		00:17:19		413		-->		00:17:20		960		Commander. 
		178		00:17:21		165		-->		00:17:25		215		But still, I don't know. 
		179		00:17:25		878		-->		00:17:29		132		But you'll agree, it is enough to present to your leader. 
		180		00:17:29		632		-->		00:17:32		602		Chorgan is a better judge of these matters. 
		181		00:17:32		802		-->		00:17:35		806		I will take it to him. You'll hear from me in 20 days. 
		182		00:17:36		013		-->		00:17:40		564		Brull, in 20 days I hope to be very far from here. 
		183		00:17:40		768		-->		00:17:43		317		With all due respect, Brull, 
		184		00:17:43		521		-->		00:17:48		493		I would like to make the offer to Chorgan myself. 
		185		00:17:49		151		-->		00:17:51		119		We'll gladly take you with us on the Enterprise. 
		186		00:17:51		320		-->		00:17:54		244		How many of your men do you want to accompany you? 
		187		00:17:54		448		-->		00:17:56		416		I'll come alone. 
		188		00:17:56		909		-->		00:18:00		083		- If this is a trap... - Oh, it isn't. 
		189		00:18:03		332		-->		00:18:06		051		Mallon, you'll be in charge while I'm gone. 
		190		00:18:06		252		-->		00:18:10		723		If I'm not back in 10 days... Brull! Brull! 
		191		00:18:17		555		-->		00:18:19		228		Volnoth. 
		192		00:18:20		933		-->		00:18:23		186		Away Team to Enterprise. Medical emergency. 
		193		00:18:23		394		-->		00:18:26		819		Volnoth was an old man. There's nothing to be done. 
		194		00:18:27		023		-->		00:18:30		072		There's a chance that our doctors can do something. 
		195		00:18:33		195		-->		00:18:34		868		- You found him? - Yes. 
		196		00:18:35		072		-->		00:18:37		112		There are no other members of the Lornack clan here. 
		197		00:18:37		283		-->		00:18:40		207		- So I claim his possessions. - Granted. 
		198		00:18:43		706		-->		00:18:45		424		Have you no respect for the dead? 
		199		00:18:45		625		-->		00:18:48		094		What's there to respect about a corpse? 
		200		00:19:03		309		-->		00:19:05		437		Temarek, no. Calm down. 
		201		00:19:05		645		-->		00:19:08		740		- He's been dead too long. - How? 
		202		00:19:08		939		-->		00:19:10		407		Cardiac arrest. 
		203		00:19:11		901		-->		00:19:13		494		You don't sound convinced. 
		204		00:19:13		694		-->		00:19:18		245		No, he died of a heart attack, all right, but I can't find the cause. 
		205		00:19:18		449		-->		00:19:23		171		His cardiac muscle is strong and there's no sign of arterial occlusion. 
		206		00:19:44		475		-->		00:19:48		605		Brull, will you show Mr. Crusher the course to set to the Hromi Cluster? 
		207		00:19:48		813		-->		00:19:51		282		Heh, a child? 
		208		00:19:53		192		-->		00:19:55		820		This doesn't inspire my confidence. 
		209		00:20:14		046		-->		00:20:16		674		This is our present position. 
		210		00:20:17		967		-->		00:20:21		267		Set a heading for 343-mark-72. 
		211		00:20:23		305		-->		00:20:26		559		That's gonna take us through the center of an asteroid belt. 
		212		00:20:26		767		-->		00:20:28		769		Hey, heh, what's the matter, kid? 
		213		00:20:28		978		-->		00:20:31		231		Can't you fly yourself around a couple of rocks? 
		214		00:20:33		274		-->		00:20:34		366		Sure I can. 
		215		00:20:34		567		-->		00:20:40		074		But if we take this heading, we can avoid the belt completely, and only lose 12.1 minutes at warp 7. 
		217		00:20:43		784		-->		00:20:45		912		Have it your way, kid. 
		218		00:20:52		793		-->		00:20:56		093		For centuries, my planet was in chaos. 
		219		00:20:56		714		-->		00:21:00		969		Loyalty to one's clan was absolute. 
		220		00:21:01		302		-->		00:21:06		684		The slightest injury to one member demanded violent retaliation. 
		221		00:21:06		891		-->		00:21:10		020		And these blood feuds could last for decades? 
		222		00:21:10		227		-->		00:21:13		026		The obsession with vengeance would be passed from generation to generation. 
		224		00:21:15		483		-->		00:21:20		535		And with each act of retribution, the violence would escalate. 
		225		00:21:21		822		-->		00:21:27		044		It's not unlike much of the history of my own planet. 
		226		00:21:28		913		-->		00:21:32		008		Your pardon, sovereign. May I be excused briefly? 
		227		00:21:32		208		-->		00:21:34		961		Commander Riker requested that I prepare him an Acamarian dish. 
		228		00:21:35		169		-->		00:21:37		422		Of course, Yuta. 
		229		00:22:03		739		-->		00:22:05		867		- What are you doing? - Homework. 
		230		00:22:06		075		-->		00:22:08		453		- Heh, what is this? - Math. 
		231		00:22:08		661		-->		00:22:11		289		I can see that, but what does it mean? 
		232		00:22:11		789		-->		00:22:13		962		This is the locally euclidean metrization of a K-fold contravariant Riemannian tensor field. 
		234		00:22:18		254		-->		00:22:20		131		You any good at it? 
		235		00:22:24		134		-->		00:22:25		477		You don't like me. 
		236		00:22:26		262		-->		00:22:29		266		- I didn't say that. - No problem. 
		237		00:22:29		473		-->		00:22:32		192		I have many friends that don't like me. 
		238		00:22:32		393		-->		00:22:34		111		But what do you know about me? 
		239		00:22:34		311		-->		00:22:35		437		You're a thief. 
		240		00:22:35		646		-->		00:22:39		492		I steal to survive, not because I enjoy it. 
		241		00:22:39		692		-->		00:22:41		535		We Gatherers value our freedom. 
		242		00:22:41		735		-->		00:22:44		614		We do what we want and we answer to no creature. 
		243		00:22:44		822		-->		00:22:47		496		Then why are you helping Sovereign Marouk to change all that? 
		244		00:22:50		119		-->		00:22:52		463		Maybe because I want something better. 
		245		00:22:52		663		-->		00:22:55		963		For me and for my children. 
		246		00:22:56		876		-->		00:23:01		723		- You have children? - Yeah, two sons. 
		247		00:23:01		922		-->		00:23:04		425		One's just about your age. 
		248		00:23:07		011		-->		00:23:09		764		He's not any good at math. 
		249		00:23:21		108		-->		00:23:22		826		Parthus Ã© la Yuta? 
		250		00:23:23		027		-->		00:23:26		452		With the help of one of your food stations. 
		251		00:23:32		828		-->		00:23:34		330		It's wonderful. 
		252		00:23:35		247		-->		00:23:37		295		- Truly excellent. - Thank you. 
		253		00:23:37		499		-->		00:23:39		251		Would you care to join us? 
		254		00:23:39		460		-->		00:23:41		178		I don't want to intrude. 
		255		00:23:43		172		-->		00:23:44		594		You're not. 
		256		00:23:45		799		-->		00:23:50		100		I was just leaving anyway. Please, sit down. 
		257		00:23:58		604		-->		00:24:00		231		It really is delicious. 
		258		00:24:00		439		-->		00:24:02		612		I am glad it pleases you, commander. 
		259		00:24:02		816		-->		00:24:05		160		I'm not your commander. My name is William. 
		260		00:24:05		361		-->		00:24:07		241		- I will call you William if you prefer. - I do. 
		261		00:24:07		446		-->		00:24:12		202		When you say "commander," you say it like you say âsovereign" to Marouk. 
		262		00:24:13		869		-->		00:24:15		621		As a servant. 
		263		00:24:19		583		-->		00:24:23		508		You're an excellent commander, but you'd make a poor sovereign. 
		264		00:24:23		963		-->		00:24:25		840		Why is that? Not that I disagree. 
		265		00:24:26		048		-->		00:24:30		178		- You're not comfortable with servants. - No, I prefer the company of equals. 
		266		00:24:30		719		-->		00:24:32		847		So you treat me as an equal. 
		267		00:24:33		055		-->		00:24:34		648		And you're not comfortable with that? 
		268		00:24:36		684		-->		00:24:40		939		I'm not used to it. I've always been a servant. 
		269		00:24:41		897		-->		00:24:45		071		Not that I'm complaining. The sovereign treats me well. 
		270		00:24:45		275		-->		00:24:47		369		I have all that I could want. 
		271		00:24:47		569		-->		00:24:49		571		What about freedom? 
		272		00:24:53		158		-->		00:24:54		876		I can never have that. 
		273		00:24:55		869		-->		00:24:57		629		Because you're the property of the sovereign? 
		274		00:24:57		830		-->		00:25:00		549		No, I'm not her slave. 
		275		00:25:00		749		-->		00:25:02		797		I can leave whenever I wish. 
		276		00:25:03		252		-->		00:25:07		428		- But you have no place to go? - Just the opposite. 
		277		00:25:09		383		-->		00:25:11		636		My path is all too clear. 
		278		00:25:12		928		-->		00:25:17		559		Yuta, you're an excellent chef, but you speak in riddles. 
		279		00:25:20		019		-->		00:25:23		694		I've never been very good at conversation. 
		280		00:25:27		860		-->		00:25:29		487		Yuta. 
		281		00:25:34		199		-->		00:25:38		249		I believe the sovereign wants me to return. Enjoy the parthus. 
		282		00:25:48		338		-->		00:25:49		931		<i>Sickba y to Riker.</i> 
		283		00:25:50		132		-->		00:25:52		351		<i>We discovered something interesting, Wilt.</i> 
		284		00:25:52		551		-->		00:25:54		269		On my Way- 
		285		00:26:01		060		-->		00:26:02		528		You're scowling, doctor. 
		286		00:26:02		728		-->		00:26:05		572		- Heh, I'm thinking. - And? 
		287		00:26:07		274		-->		00:26:09		197		The old Gatherer on the planet? 
		288		00:26:09		401		-->		00:26:12		029		I know what caused his heart attack. 
		289		00:26:12		404		-->		00:26:17		535		The medical tricorder almost missed it, but there was a microvirus in his body blocking his autonomic nerve impulses. 
		291		00:26:20		245		-->		00:26:21		588		And that stopped his heart? 
		292		00:26:23		248		-->		00:26:25		967		But here's the really interesting part. 
		293		00:26:28		420		-->		00:26:30		514		This microvirus will only attach itself to cells with a very specific DNA sequence. 
		295		00:26:35		052		-->		00:26:36		099		How specific? 
		296		00:26:37		221		-->		00:26:40		851		Without knowing more about their genetic makeup, I can't be sure. 
		297		00:26:41		058		-->		00:26:47		862		But my guess is this virus would only kill one Acamarian in a million. 
		298		00:26:48		065		-->		00:26:50		864		- Pretty single-minded bug. - Too single-minded. 
		299		00:26:51		068		-->		00:26:54		743		I can't believe it's a naturally occurring virus. 
		300		00:26:54		947		-->		00:26:56		699		Meaning someone engineered it? 
		301		00:26:57		366		-->		00:26:59		835		Meaning Volnoth was murdered. 
		302		00:27:17		302		-->		00:27:18		349		<i>Commander Riker,</i> 
		303		00:27:18		554		-->		00:27:22		275		<i>Acamar ill has agreed to your request for access to their databases.</i> 
		304		00:27:22		474		-->		00:27:25		694		<i>They are now being transmitted into our computer over subspace link.</i> 
		305		00:27:25		894		-->		00:27:30		024		Good. Notify Dr. Crusher when Acamar's medical database is online. 
		306		00:27:30		232		-->		00:27:32		075		Riker out. 
		307		00:27:38		031		-->		00:27:39		624		Come in. 
		308		00:27:40		576		-->		00:27:42		829		I'm disturbing you. 
		309		00:27:44		037		-->		00:27:45		880		Not at all. 
		310		00:27:48		208		-->		00:27:49		755		As... the sovereign has no further need for my services this evening,  she suggested I might spend some time with you. 
		313		00:28:00		304		-->		00:28:02		227		What a charming suggestion. 
		314		00:28:04		892		-->		00:28:10		740		She appreciates the affection you've shown me. 
		315		00:28:11		231		-->		00:28:12		824		Was I that obvious? 
		316		00:28:14		651		-->		00:28:16		244		Yes. 
		317		00:28:16		695		-->		00:28:19		699		Well, I've already dined. 
		318		00:28:19		907		-->		00:28:22		160		Maybe you know a good Acamarian dessert recipe. 
		319		00:28:27		122		-->		00:28:29		625		Does that not please you? 
		320		00:28:37		132		-->		00:28:41		137		Tell me what you want, William. I will do anything you wish. 
		321		00:28:41		345		-->		00:28:43		097		Wait a minute. 
		322		00:28:43		931		-->		00:28:45		899		I don't understand. 
		323		00:28:46		308		-->		00:28:48		481		Don't you want me to give you pleasure? 
		324		00:28:48		685		-->		00:28:50		358		Not as a servant. 
		325		00:28:51		188		-->		00:28:53		156		I told you, I prefer equals. 
		326		00:28:53		815		-->		00:28:55		738		Even in the matters of love? 
		327		00:28:56		902		-->		00:28:58		996		Especially in matters of love. 
		328		00:29:00		155		-->		00:29:02		249		I've offended you. 
		329		00:29:02		991		-->		00:29:06		746		No, I only wanna make you as happy as you wanna make me. 
		330		00:29:06		954		-->		00:29:09		423		You're entitled to that. 
		331		00:29:10		249		-->		00:29:14		345		<i>- No, I'm not. - Yum.</i> 
		332		00:29:16		088		-->		00:29:19		968		I do not feel pleasure or passion. 
		333		00:29:20		467		-->		00:29:23		892		I haven't been able to for a long time. 
		334		00:29:31		645		-->		00:29:34		194		I don't know who did this to you, or why,  but it can change. 
		337		00:29:40		487		-->		00:29:42		615		I wish it could. 
		338		00:29:43		323		-->		00:29:45		792		Tonight most of all. 
		339		00:29:47		494		-->		00:29:48		871		I'm sorry. 
		340		00:30:11		018		-->		00:30:12		736		Your people have prepared a warm welcome. 
		341		00:30:12		936		-->		00:30:14		233		That's Chorgan's ship. 
		342		00:30:19		443		-->		00:30:23		289		- Shields holding. - Mr. Worf, contact Chorgan. 
		343		00:30:23		488		-->		00:30:25		991		Tell him Brull has brought us to talk. 
		344		00:30:30		120		-->		00:30:31		793		Chorgan is not responding. 
		345		00:30:34		041		-->		00:30:35		714		Mr. Worf, can we knock out their shields without seriously damaging their ship? 
		347		00:30:41		173		-->		00:30:42		925		I believe we can, sir. 
		348		00:30:43		133		-->		00:30:45		386		Prepare phasers and open a channel. 
		349		00:30:45		594		-->		00:30:47		722		Phasers locked. Channel open. 
		350		00:30:47		929		-->		00:30:52		776		Chorgan, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterpri... 
		351		00:30:54		311		-->		00:30:56		313		All right. 
		352		00:30:57		397		-->		00:31:00		196		Let's focus their attention. 
		353		00:31:00		400		-->		00:31:03		404		Mr. Worf, fire phasers. 
		354		00:31:09		910		-->		00:31:12		459		Their forward shields are inoperative. 
		355		00:31:12		662		-->		00:31:14		664		Well done, lieutenant. 
		356		00:31:16		666		-->		00:31:20		591		- We are being hailed, sir. - That's better. 
		357		00:31:20		796		-->		00:31:22		264		On screen. 
		358		00:31:23		715		-->		00:31:26		264		<i>Brull, you traitor!</i> 
		359		00:31:26		468		-->		00:31:28		470		<i>You have led them here to destroy me!</i> 
		360		00:31:28		678		-->		00:31:30		351		Chorgan, if I had wanted you destroyed, you would not be talking to me now. 
		362		00:31:33		392		-->		00:31:35		440		Obviously I wanted something else. 
		363		00:31:35		644		-->		00:31:37		271		<i>And what is that?</i> 
		364		00:31:37		479		-->		00:31:39		823		I have on board Sovereign Marouk of Acamar Ill. 
		365		00:31:40		023		-->		00:31:42		276		I want you to hear what she and Brull have to say. 
		366		00:31:42		484		-->		00:31:43		656		She's worth listening to. 
		367		00:31:43		860		-->		00:31:45		908		<i>I don't wish to listen to either of you.</i> 
		368		00:31:46		113		-->		00:31:47		990		You have no choice. Prepare to receive us. 
		369		00:31:48		198		-->		00:31:50		542		We are beaming on board. Picard out. 
		370		00:31:52		035		-->		00:31:53		753		Cancel red alert. 
		371		00:31:53		954		-->		00:31:56		332		Tell Sovereign Marouk to meet me in Transporter 3. 
		372		00:31:56		540		-->		00:31:58		213		Aye, sir. 
		373		00:31:58		417		-->		00:32:01		170		- You're going alone, captain? - The danger is minimal, Number One. 
		374		00:32:01		628		-->		00:32:03		301		Chorgan is unlikely to do anything rash with the Enterprise's phasers trained on his ship. 
		376		00:32:05		882		-->		00:32:07		976		There are still risks. 
		377		00:32:09		219		-->		00:32:14		726		For these negotiations to succeed, I must be a mediator, not an enforcer. 
		378		00:32:15		350		-->		00:32:17		648		You have the Bridge, Number One. 
		379		00:32:17		853		-->		00:32:19		480		Brull. 
		380		00:32:34		953		-->		00:32:38		674		Chorgan, this is Sovereign Marouk. 
		381		00:32:39		749		-->		00:32:41		843		You may sit. 
		382		00:32:46		381		-->		00:32:47		849		Oh. 
		383		00:32:49		468		-->		00:32:51		436		Chorgan, I think you will find Marouk's proposal... 
		384		00:32:51		636		-->		00:32:53		104		You know, Picard, 
		385		00:32:54		514		-->		00:32:56		733		I could take you prisoner, heh. 
		386		00:32:58		268		-->		00:33:02		318		Oh, don't worry. I've no intention of doing so. 
		387		00:33:02		522		-->		00:33:05		617		I know what trouble it's been for you to get here. 
		388		00:33:05		817		-->		00:33:07		819		And I'm curious why. 
		389		00:33:08		028		-->		00:33:09		371		Then let's proceed. 
		390		00:33:09		571		-->		00:33:13		951		Quite simply, I'm proposing amnesty for every Gatherer. 
		391		00:33:14		159		-->		00:33:15		376		Amnesty? 
		392		00:33:17		287		-->		00:33:18		459		You mean slavery. 
		393		00:33:18		663		-->		00:33:20		381		Chorgan, if you want to know what I think... 
		394		00:33:20		582		-->		00:33:22		425		I don't. 
		395		00:33:23		001		-->		00:33:27		472		Say what you came to say, but I doubt I'm going to believe you. 
		396		00:33:27		672		-->		00:33:31		552		I didn't believe this very persuasive Federation captain when he suggested we could reconcile our differences. 
		398		00:33:34		679		-->		00:33:40		186		I'm convinced now it is the right thing, not just for you, but for us too. 
		399		00:33:40		393		-->		00:33:41		770		We need you back. 
		400		00:33:46		149		-->		00:33:50		029		I've brought some Acamarian brandy, heh. 
		401		00:33:50		237		-->		00:33:52		456		I'm sure it's been a long time. 
		402		00:33:52		656		-->		00:33:57		127		Hmm. No. You have spent a century hunting us down. 
		403		00:33:57		327		-->		00:33:59		500		She is trying to put an end to all that. 
		404		00:33:59		704		-->		00:34:02		048		Yes, and luring us back and putting us in prison. 
		405		00:34:02		249		-->		00:34:04		923		No, by accepting you back as free men. 
		406		00:34:05		126		-->		00:34:07		720		Will you feed us? And clothe us too? 
		407		00:34:07		921		-->		00:34:10		015		No, of course, I won't. 
		408		00:34:10		215		-->		00:34:14		686		What I will do is give you the means to feed and clothe yourself. 
		409		00:34:14		886		-->		00:34:17		730		We've set aside some land and you can use it to... 
		410		00:34:21		184		-->		00:34:23		312		Land? 
		411		00:34:24		354		-->		00:34:27		574		Do we look like farmers to you? 
		412		00:34:27		774		-->		00:34:32		029		Then don't farm. Use the land as you wish. It's yours. 
		413		00:34:32		237		-->		00:34:36		583		And the moment you set foot on it, you'll be better off than you are today. 
		414		00:34:36		783		-->		00:34:39		002		You won't be running any longer. 
		415		00:34:40		203		-->		00:34:42		956		- We will need autonomy. - Autonomy? 
		416		00:34:43		164		-->		00:34:45		417		Sovereign, we can at least acknowledge that Chorgan appears willing to discuss your offer. 
		418		00:34:52		632		-->		00:34:55		181		There are many levels of autonomy. 
		419		00:34:55		385		-->		00:34:58		309		Certainly your region would have certain rights. 
		420		00:34:58		513		-->		00:34:59		810		Yes. 
		421		00:35:00		348		-->		00:35:06		606		And those rights will be spelled out before I agree to anything. 
		422		00:35:07		939		-->		00:35:11		489		Commander, I am afraid the only entry we have on Volnoth in the Acamarian database is a birth record. 
		424		00:35:15		196		-->		00:35:18		621		Probably one of the last of the Gatherers to be born on their planet. 
		425		00:35:19		034		-->		00:35:20		081		CRUSHER Commander, 
		426		00:35:21		077		-->		00:35:24		672		I've been digging through the medical database from Acamar Ill for hours. 
		427		00:35:24		873		-->		00:35:29		219		And I have found another victim of the same microvirus that killed Volnoth. 
		428		00:35:29		419		-->		00:35:31		296		But only one. 
		429		00:35:31		504		-->		00:35:35		509		Fifty-three years ago, a Gatherer named Penthor-Mul. 
		430		00:35:35		717		-->		00:35:39		062		Data, anything in your file on Penthor-Mul? 
		431		00:35:39		638		-->		00:35:42		642		Yes, sir. He was a member of the Lornack clan. 
		432		00:35:42		849		-->		00:35:45		352		He was captured while leading a Gatherer raid on an Acamarian outpost. 
		434		00:35:48		396		-->		00:35:50		945		He died of a heart attack before his trial ended. 
		435		00:35:52		984		-->		00:35:56		113		Display Volnoth's birth record again. 
		436		00:36:02		077		-->		00:36:04		205		Lornack, the same clan. 
		437		00:36:04		746		-->		00:36:08		501		The only two recorded deaths by this microvirus, both from the same clan. 
		438		00:36:08		667		-->		00:36:09		919		What does that tell us, doctor? 
		439		00:36:10		919		-->		00:36:13		013		If these microbes were engineered for murder, 
		440		00:36:13		213		-->		00:36:16		717		I'd say somebody could be going after a whole family. 
		441		00:36:16		925		-->		00:36:20		975		Commander, Chorgan, the present leader of the Gatherers, is also from the Lornack clan. 
		443		00:36:23		807		-->		00:36:25		327		I wanna know how this clan was involved with the Acamarian blood feuds. 
		445		00:36:27		143		-->		00:36:29		987		And I'd like to know any clue as to who their enemies were. 
		446		00:36:30		188		-->		00:36:32		361		How could this virus have been transmitted, doctor? 
		447		00:36:32		565		-->		00:36:34		158		More ways than I can count. 
		448		00:36:34		359		-->		00:36:36		032		And it's perfectly safe to the carrier as long as he doesn't have the same DNA patterns. 
		450		00:36:38		738		-->		00:36:40		456		Tailor-made for their enemies. 
		451		00:36:40		657		-->		00:36:43		627		Commander, 80 years ago, the Lornacks massacred a rival clan, the Tralestas. 
		453		00:36:47		664		-->		00:36:50		292		It ended a feud that had lasted for 200 years. 
		454		00:36:50		500		-->		00:36:51		547		Ended it? 
		455		00:36:51		751		-->		00:36:54		220		According to these records, there were no survivors. 
		456		00:36:54		421		-->		00:36:56		423		The Tralestas were annihilated. 
		457		00:36:56		631		-->		00:36:59		680		Something tells me they weren't all wiped out. 
		458		00:36:59		884		-->		00:37:01		852		There must be a missing link here. 
		459		00:37:02		053		-->		00:37:05		148		Computer, any members of the Acamarian delegation from the Tralesta clan? 
		461		00:37:07		892		-->		00:37:10		862		<i>Clan affiliation is not within provided records.</i> 
		462		00:37:11		521		-->		00:37:13		023		Sir, 
		463		00:37:13		648		-->		00:37:17		278		I believe I have found a correlation between the two deaths. 
		464		00:37:17		736		-->		00:37:20		410		Your missing link. 
		465		00:37:24		909		-->		00:37:28		539		That is Penthor-Mul being led from his trial. 
		466		00:37:29		289		-->		00:37:31		007		I don't see the connection. 
		467		00:37:31		207		-->		00:37:33		460		Behind him and to the left, sir. 
		468		00:37:33		668		-->		00:37:36		922		Computer, scan left and magnify. 
		469		00:37:40		341		-->		00:37:44		096		The computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the face, sir. 
		470		00:37:44		304		-->		00:37:45		772		Do it. 
		471		00:37:51		352		-->		00:37:56		233		But that photograph was taken over 50 years ago. 
		472		00:37:59		778		-->		00:38:04		375		Fifty-three years ago, and she hasn't aged a day. 
		473		00:38:15		668		-->		00:38:18		296		Three seats on the ruling council? 
		474		00:38:18		505		-->		00:38:23		011		If we're going to be subject to your law, we want a part in making it. 
		475		00:38:23		218		-->		00:38:26		563		Well, I agree you're entitled to representation, but not on the ruling council. 
		477		00:38:29		224		-->		00:38:31		226		Unacceptable. 
		478		00:38:31		434		-->		00:38:33		812		The real power is in the council. 
		479		00:38:34		020		-->		00:38:35		522		You are shutting us off already. 
		480		00:38:35		730		-->		00:38:37		903		No, you're trying to take too much! 
		481		00:38:38		107		-->		00:38:40		405		No group has three seats on the council! 
		482		00:38:40		610		-->		00:38:43		079		I don't care what others have! 
		483		00:38:43		279		-->		00:38:47		204		You only care about what you can take! 
		484		00:38:47		408		-->		00:38:50		958		Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, 
		485		00:38:51		162		-->		00:38:55		417		I'm sure you would be demanding equal levels of representation. 
		486		00:38:57		585		-->		00:38:59		633		You're right, captain. 
		487		00:39:01		256		-->		00:39:04		100		I apologize for my temper. 
		488		00:39:15		895		-->		00:39:19		991		Perhaps a brief pause would be helpful. 
		489		00:39:21		484		-->		00:39:23		236		I agree. 
		490		00:39:24		487		-->		00:39:26		205		Hmm. 
		491		00:39:26		364		-->		00:39:29		117		Maybe a little touch of that brandy. 
		492		00:39:30		034		-->		00:39:31		081		Yuta. 
		493		00:39:32		036		-->		00:39:33		754		You know... Thank you. 
		494		00:39:33		955		-->		00:39:38		631		It is remarkable how very much alike the two of you actually are. 
		495		00:39:38		835		-->		00:39:40		462		- That's ridiculous. - Really, captain. 
		496		00:39:40		670		-->		00:39:41		967		No, I'm quite serious. 
		497		00:39:42		171		-->		00:39:45		220		You are both able negotiators, strong leaders... 
		498		00:39:45		425		-->		00:39:46		893		We don't obey weak leaders. 
		499		00:39:47		093		-->		00:39:49		613		We have nothing in common at all. We haven't agreed to anything. 
		500		00:39:49		804		-->		00:39:51		522		You're wrong, Chorgan. 
		501		00:39:51		723		-->		00:39:53		851		We have agreed to have some brandy together. 
		502		00:39:58		479		-->		00:40:00		652		- Don't move. - A Federation trap! 
		503		00:40:01		149		-->		00:40:06		246		Chorgan, I assure you, my first officer has a very good reason for his actions. 
		504		00:40:06		446		-->		00:40:08		540		You do, Number One? 
		505		00:40:09		032		-->		00:40:12		536		Yuta, move away from Chorgan. 
		506		00:40:12		744		-->		00:40:14		587		- Do it. - Why? 
		507		00:40:15		038		-->		00:40:18		133		Because of a man you once knew named Penthor-Mul. 
		508		00:40:18		333		-->		00:40:19		801		Penthor-Mul? 
		509		00:40:20		001		-->		00:40:22		754		- How do you know Penthor-Mul? - Tell him, Yuta. 
		510		00:40:24		714		-->		00:40:25		761		I don't understand. 
		511		00:40:25		965		-->		00:40:28		935		You were with Penthor-Mul when he died. 
		512		00:40:29		344		-->		00:40:33		724		- It was 5O years ago. How could I...? - I know, Yuta. 
		513		00:40:33		932		-->		00:40:37		482		Stop! Chorgan, keep perfectly still. 
		514		00:40:37		685		-->		00:40:41		064		Your life is in danger. Step back, Yuta. 
		515		00:40:43		733		-->		00:40:46		532		- William, this is not your concern. - It is now. 
		516		00:40:47		111		-->		00:40:48		704		You're about to commit a murder. 
		517		00:40:48		905		-->		00:40:52		876		It isn't murder! It's justice. 
		518		00:40:53		076		-->		00:40:54		453		Who are you? 
		519		00:40:55		662		-->		00:40:57		881		Yuta of the clan Tralesta. 
		520		00:40:58		081		-->		00:41:00		334		There are no more Tralestas. 
		521		00:41:01		459		-->		00:41:04		429		Five survived the last Lornack raid. 
		522		00:41:04		796		-->		00:41:07		094		But on that day a century ago, my life ended and my search began. 
		524		00:41:13		972		-->		00:41:18		102		I was the one chosen, transformed. 
		525		00:41:18		685		-->		00:41:23		065		My cells were altered, my aging slowed, enough to finish my task. 
		527		00:41:25		483		-->		00:41:29		533		You used me in order to get to the last few you couldn't reach. 
		528		00:41:29		737		-->		00:41:31		034		Yes, sovereign. 
		529		00:41:31		239		-->		00:41:34		664		You will never leave this ship alive. 
		530		00:41:34		867		-->		00:41:36		869		You're the last. 
		531		00:41:37		078		-->		00:41:42		380		Once you're dead, what happens to me doesn't matter. 
		532		00:41:42		583		-->		00:41:44		176		The wars are over, Yuta. 
		533		00:41:45		920		-->		00:41:49		424		- You cannot understand. - You're right, I can't. 
		534		00:41:49		632		-->		00:41:52		232		Because I've seen the part of you that regrets what you've become. 
		535		00:41:52		427		-->		00:41:56		182		Listen to me. You don't have to do this anymore. 
		536		00:42:00		101		-->		00:42:01		774		I have no choice. 
		537		00:42:02		311		-->		00:42:03		858		You do. 
		538		00:42:05		815		-->		00:42:07		692		William, I... 
		539		00:42:09		444		-->		00:42:10		946		I'm sorry. 
		540		00:42:12		113		-->		00:42:13		740		Stop! 
		541		00:42:31		716		-->		00:42:33		343		Yuta. 
		542		00:42:39		223		-->		00:42:41		317		Don't do this. 
		543		00:43:07		001		-->		00:43:10		801		Commander, I am in your debt. 
		544		00:43:38		533		-->		00:43:40		456		Oh, yes, thank you. 
		545		00:43:46		374		-->		00:43:47		796		New orders from Starfleet. 
		546		00:43:48		000		-->		00:43:49		502		The rendezvous... Nothing, thank you. 
		547		00:43:49		710		-->		00:43:52		133		Rendezvous with the Garcia has been postponed. 
		548		00:43:52		338		-->		00:43:57		094		- In the meantime? - Starbase 343. 
		549		00:43:57		301		-->		00:44:00		726		We're gonna take on medical supplies for the Alpha Leonis system. 
		550		00:44:00		930		-->		00:44:03		228		Sounds pretty routine. 
		551		00:44:03		432		-->		00:44:06		732		Well, with the Gatherer truce in effect, it certainly should be. 
		552		00:44:06		936		-->		00:44:08		358		Oh. 
		553		00:44:08		563		-->		00:44:12		067		We won't require a full ship's complement. 
		554		00:44:12		608		-->		00:44:16		613		I'm going to extend short leave on the starbase to anyone who wants it. 
		555		00:44:20		116		-->		00:44:23		086		I'll pass that along to the crew, captain.
